            <h2>Project Scope Blah</h2>
            <p>Recruit to Riches is a project analyzing individual high school football players recruiting rankings and how good of a probability indicator these rankings are on whether they will get drafted into the National Football League. Our team utilized the recruiting ranking website 247sports, which employs a proprietary algorithm that compiles prospect "rankings" and "ratings" listed in the public domain by the major media recruiting services. It converts average industry ranks and ratings into a linear composite index capping at 1.0000, which indicates a consensus No. 1 prospect across all services. We scraped the 247 site via the Python library "Beautiful Soup" for recruiting rankings from the years 2007-2012 and then analyzed with these results against our NFL draft csv data from the years 2010-2017.</p>
