# Recruit-to-Riches

Recruit to Riches is a project analyzing individual high school football players recruiting rankings and how good of a probability indicator these rankings are on whether they will get drafted into the National Football League.

Our team will utilize the recruiting ranking database 247sports, which utilizes a proprietary algorithm that compiles prospect "rankings" and "ratings" listed in the public domain by the major media recruiting services. It converts average industry ranks and ratings into a linear composite index capping at 1.0000, which indicates a consensus No. 1 prospect across all services.
