# Recruit-to-Riches

## Project Scope

### Introduction
Recruit to Riches is a project analyzing individual high school football players recruiting rankings and how good of a probability indicator these rankings are on whether they will get drafted into the National Football League.

Our team will use the recruiting ranking website 247sports, which utilizes a proprietary algorithm that compiles prospect "rankings" and "ratings" listed in the public domain by the major media recruiting services. It converts average industry ranks and ratings into a linear composite index capping at 1.0000, which indicates a consensus No. 1 prospect across all services. We will scrape the 247 site via the Python library "Beautiful Soup" for recruiting rankings from the years 2007-2012.

Once we have compilied our recruiting ranking data we will then analyze NFL draft csv data provided by Pro-Football-Referce.com from the years 2010-2017. Our goal is to draw conculsions regarding the sucess rate of whether a "3-Star", "4-Star", and "5-star" rating will be drafted into the NFL. We will present our findings throught the use of a variety of visual representations.

### Questions to be Answered 
Our team will look to answer the following questions

-Do recruiting rankings accurately reflect the skill of a player and their likelyhood to be drafted to the NFL?
-What towns and cities have the highest concentration of players rated in the 247sports composite?
-What towns and cities have the highest concentration of players drafted to the NFL? 
-Do recruits that signed with certain collegiate programs have a higher chance of being drafted?
